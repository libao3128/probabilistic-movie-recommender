# Probabilistic Movie Recommender

## üìò Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset, focusing on **probabilistic modeling** techniques. We aim to explore various approaches such as:

- Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)
- Collaborative Filtering (User- and Item-based KNN)
- Content-Based Filtering using genre metadata
- Hybrid models (linear combination and deep hybrid)
- Potential extensions: Bayesian modeling, neural-symbolic reasoning

Evaluation is conducted using both **rating prediction** (RMSE, MAE) and **top-K recommendation** metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### Data

MovieLens offers datasets of various sizes. For faster iteration during development, use a smaller dataset; for final experiments, use the full dataset.

#### Final Results

1. Download the MovieLens 32M dataset from the [GroupLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Extract it to `data/ml-32m` in your project directory.

#### Development

1. Download the MovieLens "latest small" dataset from the [GroupLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Extract it to `data/ml-latest-small` in your project directory.

## üìä Benchmark Results

The following table summarizes the performance (on the test set) of different recommendation models evaluated in this project:

| Model                                      | RMSE   | MAE    |
|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)  | 0.9043 | 0.6915 |
| Bayesian PMF                              | 0.8642 | 0.6551 |
| SPN (Sum-Product Network)                 | 1.3454 | 0.9134 |
| Frequent Pattern Mining + MLN             | 1.3301 | 1.0390 |

> Note: Lower RMSE and MAE indicate better predictive accuracy.
