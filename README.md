# Probabilistic Movie Recommender

## üìò Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset, focusing on **probabilistic modeling** techniques. We explore and compare the following models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (User-based and Item-based)
- Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)
- Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization
- Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM)
- Frequent Pattern Mining + Markov Logic Network (FP + MLN)
- Sum-Product Network (SPN)

Models are evaluated on both **rating prediction accuracy** (RMSE, MAE), **computational efficiency** (training/inference time), and **interpretability**.  
The goal is to provide insights into the trade-offs between performance, scalability, and explainability for probabilistic recommenders in real-world applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

### Data

MovieLens offers datasets of various sizes. For faster iteration during development, use a smaller dataset; for final experiments, use the full dataset.

#### Final Results

1. Download the MovieLens 32M dataset from the [GroupLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Extract it to `data/ml-32m` in your project directory.

#### Development

1. Download the MovieLens "latest small" dataset from the [GroupLens website](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
2. Extract it to `data/ml-latest-small` in your project directory.
