# Probabilistic Movie Recommender

## üìò Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset, focusing on **probabilistic modeling** techniques. We aim to explore various approaches such as:

- Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)
- Collaborative Filtering (User- and Item-based KNN)
- Content-Based Filtering using genre metadata
- Hybrid models (linear combination and deep hybrid)
- Potential extensions: Bayesian modeling, neural-symbolic reasoning

Evaluation is conducted using both **rating prediction** (RMSE, MAE) and **top-K recommendation** metrics (Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG@K).
